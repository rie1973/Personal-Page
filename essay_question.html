        <h2>Should page authors use non-standard additions to HTML?</h2>
        <h3>What if they are proposed specs in non-finalized versions?</h3>
        <section>
            <blockquote>
                <pre>
                    I do not believe that page authors should use non-standard additions in their HTML code. 
                    By doing so, I think it will decrease the compatibility of their pages on different browsers. 
                    Also, the needs of the readers should be more important than a “desired effect,” especially 
                    if that “effect” may impact the accessibility for users with visual or other impairments. I feel 
                    that this would be unethical.
  
                    I also feel that if it is then used by other developers from different companies, the introduction 
                    of non-standardized additions to HTML would set back the years of work that went into creating 
                    standards in the first place. The last thing the internet needs is a rehash of the fight between 
                    Netscape and Microsoft (1). 

                    If the non-standard additions are part of a non-finalized version of the code, it should be 
                    reviewed by the department as whole and the final decision to use the code should come down 
                    to a consensus vote. In the article, <a href="https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/web-standards-bust/" target="blank">“Giving Web Standards a Seat at the Table"</a>, the author, 
                    Jay Hoffman , points out that when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Holzschlag" target="blank">Molly Holzschlag</a> spoke with the Internet Explorer team 
                    at Microsoft,she was surprised to find that there was some support for standardization among 
                    some of the team members (1). A consensus vote on the use of non-standard additions would 
                    ensure that the entire webpage team would not only be aware of the proposed use of the addition,  
                    but it would also give them a chance to voice any concerns or oppositions they may have over the 
                    use of the code. Instead, the team should work with the<a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="blank">W3C</a> to integrate any proposed non-standard 
                    additions into the next batch of updated <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/" target="blank">W3C HTML5 standards</a>.
