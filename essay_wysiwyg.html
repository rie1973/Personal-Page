<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">What if they are proposed specs in non-finalized versions?</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">I do not believe that page authors should use non-standard additions in their HTML code. By doing so, I think it will decrease the compatibility of their pages on different browsers. Also, the needs of the readers should be more important than a &ldquo;desired effect,&rdquo; especially if that &ldquo;effect&rdquo; may impact the accessibility for users with visual or other impairments.&nbsp; I also feel that if it is then used by other developers from different companies, the introduction of non-standardized additions to HTML would set back the years of work that went into creating standards in the first place. The last thing the internet needs and a rehash of the fight between Netscape and Microsoft (1). </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">If the non-standard additions are part of a non-finalized version of the code, it should be reviewed by the department as whole and the final decision to use the code should come down to a consensus vote. In the article, &ldquo;Giving Web Standards a Seat at the Table&rsquo; the author, Jay Hoffman (1), points out that when Molly Holzschlag spoke with the Internet Explorer team at Microsoft, she was surprised to see there was some support for standardization amongst some of the team members. A consensus vote on the use of non-standard additions would assure the webpage team would not only be aware of the proposed use of the addition, but it would also give them a chance to voice any concerns or oppositions they may have over the use of the code. Instead, the team should work with the W3C to integrate any proposed non-standard additions into the next batch of updated W3C standards.</span></span></span></span></p>
